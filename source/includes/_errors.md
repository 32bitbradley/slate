## Response error codes

```json
{
    "data": {},
    "error": 0,
    "message": "Pong!",
    "meta": {
        "items": 0,
        "meta": null
    },
    "success": true
}
```

The JSON response (If one is provided) will also contain an integer 'error' field at the JSON's array root with a corresponding error code.

The below table shows all possible API error codes. If you encounter an error code that is not in this table, please publicly shun my programming skills by tweeting the mysterious error code to @32bitbradley.
